    <title>Transaction Log :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/14-transactions-and-indexes/4-transaction-log/</link>

It’s more of a, what happens underneath the hood sort of thing. So we talked about transactions last time, right? Transactions are a essentially a receipt for any, any SQL that we actually execute on our database, including selects, updates, inserts, and deletes.</description>
