    <description>Video Transcription This topic I’m going to be mostly skimming through, it’s important to be aware of, but not, I’m not really going to be testing on it. It’s more of a, what happens underneath the hood sort of thing. So we talked about transactions last time, right? Transactions are a essentially a receipt for any, any SQL that we actually execute on our database, including selects, updates, inserts, and deletes. These are really important, because that allows us to enforce acid, which remember animosity. So either all or nothing. So we can’t have if we do for updating 100 rows, acid implies that we can’t update 50 of them and let the other 50 Just go out into cyberspace, right? So consistency, which is really important. So think of a database as as just a bunch of states, right? When we do an update, we transition from one state of the database where those updates don’t exist to a state of the database that those updates exist.</description>
