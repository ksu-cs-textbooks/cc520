    <description>Video Transcription Let’s check out transactions. So as I mentioned before, transactions are kind of like a receipt for any of the queries that you actually execute for your database. Typically, if you’re working with data that is just on your local database transactions are a little bit overkill, it must that data is actually very sensitive. And then transactions are needed to prevent any loss of data in transit. But when you have a bunch of people using the same database at the same time, there are more than likely going to be collisions from time to time. So more than one person tried to read or to write, update or delete the same record. And things get a little bit wonky, right, because you can’t update if you update a record and try to delete a record at the exact same time. Right, it gets weird. So that’s why we need this for multiple users. But the transaction as as a whole is one unit of work.</description>
