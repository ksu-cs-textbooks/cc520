    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to take a look at variables and SQL. So variables are a little bit different than compared to your normal programming languages, primarily just the way they syntax that they’re, that they’re declared their scope and things like that. And we’ll be covering variables briefly in this video. And then we’ll cover them a little bit more in depth as we get to more some more complicated SQL examples.</description>
