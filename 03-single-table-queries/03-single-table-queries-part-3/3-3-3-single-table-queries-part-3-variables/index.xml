    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to take a look at variables and SQL. So variables are a little bit different than compared to your normal programming languages, primarily just the way they syntax that they’re, that they’re declared their scope and things like that. And we’ll be covering variables briefly in this video. And then we’ll cover them a little bit more in depth as we get to more some more complicated SQL examples. But to declare a variable, you actually use the declare statements. But you do not have to actually initially initialize a variable with a value, you can leave it blank, the default No, the default value is no if you do not include an as an initial value. So the syntax is always though included an at symbol, and the at symbol is going to make this name a variable Without it, your variable declaration will not work.</description>
