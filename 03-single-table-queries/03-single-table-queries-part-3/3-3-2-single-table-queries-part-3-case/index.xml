    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at the case statement in SQL. So the case statement is very, very much like the switch statements in Java, although in Python, they don’t have the language to have a switch statement. But just like a chained if else clause. So in its simple form, it’s going to compare scalar values, so like numbers and things like that, and return a value with its first match. Now, there is also a different form, which evaluates a predicate looking for the first match for that predicate. And the first match is identified when the predicate turns true. And now, there’s a lot of useful functions that we can utilize as part of the case statements, which include is no coalesce if and choose. So we won’t necessarily use all of these, but some of these are quite useful. So is Knowles kind of self explanatory finds the first no value. And then coalesce is going to evaluate arguments in order. So whatever your expression is, and then all of the columns or whatever that you include there, and it’s going to evaluate all of those in order and find the first one that does not have initially evaluate to know.</description>
