    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we are going to take a look at how we pick certain specify the number of rows that we actually want to return. And this is without the actual where filter and things like that all the even though, we can actually include that. So the first one that we’re going to talk about here is top. Now, top is not standard in SQL, you will only find it in certain database management systems. For example, SQL Server actually has the top keyword or top filter, I will talk about the anti standard here in just a minute. But top filters are rows based on order. So you can say, let’s say I want the top five rows by my results. And so based off of the ordering of the results, it will take the first x or n number of rows from it. So if I did top five, it gives me the top five rows. So you say top and then there’s, you specify the number or using an expression that you want to pick. And then you can specify whether you want the top in rows, or top in percent rows, right.</description>
