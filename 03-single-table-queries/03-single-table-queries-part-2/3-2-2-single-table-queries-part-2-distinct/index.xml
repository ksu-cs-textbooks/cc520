    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back, everyone. So let’s continue diving into adding more and more elements into our single table queries. In this video, we’re going to cover the distinct qualifier. So distinct allows us to guarantee uniqueness and the things that actually come out and are result of our query. So by default, we select all things. So all of the values inside of each of the columns that we actually pick. Now, when we use distinct, each of the columns that we specify to be distinct, we verify that those records are unique. So if we have five color, five rows that have the color blue, but if we only want the distinct records, those records that have duplicates will be removed from our result. So like aggregates, all is the default of our select, if distinct, is not specified. So when we do select orders, select star from orders, or select whatever from whatever table source that you have, by default, we’re pulling all of those records out. But if we add distinct in there, we actually guarantee you that each record is unique. So when we add that distinct, each of the tuples or, or the resulting set, it has only unique values.</description>
