      <description>Video Transcription Hello everyone, In this video series, we’re going to be taking a look at some simple queries. Now, in this, in this video series, we’ll cover quite a few things, everything you need to know about a full simple query, including how to how to select columns, pick tables out the table that you want to actually pull data from, and filtering those results from those tables. Now, in a lot of programming languages, like Python, for example, everything is an object. And very similar idea here with databases, and particularly with SQL Server, almost every single thing inside of it is considered an object. So each of your tables there, we’ll be talking about views, procedures, and there’s even some functions, and all sorts of other things that we’ll be covering in this course.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription Alright, so now that we have reviewed some of the basics, let’s go back to writing some actual queries. So we’ve already ran some basic select queries before, but we didn’t really break them down into into what each part actually contains. So we’ll start out first by looking at a select, but without the from clause. So the from clause is actually optional. But the Select is required. So this is the SQL syntax here. And I will show more things like this as we add more statements and elements to our SQL query. But this is about as basic as you can go. And then the square brackets there, that denotes an optional element. So the from clause is optional. But let’s without further ado, take a look at select select is the only thing required in a SELECT clause. So we don’t actually have to have a table to pull from, we can actually project data just without any initial data source, though usually, and the vast majority of queries you’ll actually use, we will have a From clause associated with the select. So you select these columns from this table, or from this data source, essentially was what that boils out to, can also rename the columns that we actually select. If our database design is done correctly, or done well, so to speak, we shouldn’t have to add a lot of aliasing here. But column alias aliases are really helpful when we are pulling data from multiple tables. And then also when we’re actually showcasing query results back to the actual user. Because a lot of times the database column names aren’t necessarily super user friendly. As far as in the user, it may be fine for a database engineer designer, but not so much for the end end result. I’ll showcase some aliasing here in just a second.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription So now that we have actually worked a little bit with select and from So specifying which tables we want to pull data from, and which columns from those from those tables we want. Now we can actually filter which rows that we want. So the from clause is again, right the selection operation, right. So it is all of the rows, all of the rows of data that we want to pull as part of our query. Now, select does filter a little bit, but it filters only vertically. So it filters which columns actually end up showing up. But to filter which rows show up, we need the where clause, the where clause, as I mentioned, just provides the basic filtering per row. And now it will accept any predicate or Boolean expression as part of it. So all of the Boolean expressions that you’ve learned so far in just your basic programming, will actually apply here, for the most part. So we are partially supporting the selection operations.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. Now in this video we are going to be taking a look at group by and having. So before we took a look at simple SELECT FROM clause or from query, along with where so remember, we select columns from our table, and where is there to filter out the rows. So remember that we have the selection and projection operation. So the selection being the from and where clause. So the selection of what rows of data are we going to include in our results, and then the the projection or the select statement in our SQL query is which columns are we going to include in our on our query result. But now we can actually also group those rows together, right. So after we have whichever rows that we actually have in which columns that we have, we can actually group the results by certain conditions. So each of these though, by the way, right, these are all still all optional items. So if you ever look at the actual official documentation, everything in these square brackets here are optional statements that can be included in your SQL query.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back, everyone. So this will be our last little video for our single table queries part one series. But in this video, we’ll talk about processing order of our query. Now, before I talked a little bit about how our SQL language is not a procedural language, so we’re not going step by step, line by line from line one to line x, in order that they actually happen. So there’s a different processing order that actually happens than what’s actually shown on the screen. So we talked a lot about the major elements of select, and we’ll talk more about the SELECT query. Later in this class, we’ll add some more elements to it. But the core bits here are SELECT FROM WHERE group by and having are the ones that we’ve talked about so far. Now, the order is not the order that they are shown here on the screen, it does not go from SELECT FROM WHERE group by having, we actually go to the from clause first.</description>
