    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back, everyone. So this will be our last little video for our single table queries part one series. But in this video, we’ll talk about processing order of our query. Now, before I talked a little bit about how our SQL language is not a procedural language, so we’re not going step by step, line by line from line one to line x, in order that they actually happen. So there’s a different processing order that actually happens than what’s actually shown on the screen. So we talked a lot about the major elements of select, and we’ll talk more about the SELECT query. Later in this class, we’ll add some more elements to it. But the core bits here are SELECT FROM WHERE group by and having are the ones that we’ve talked about so far. Now, the order is not the order that they are shown here on the screen, it does not go from SELECT FROM WHERE group by having, we actually go to the from clause first.</description>
