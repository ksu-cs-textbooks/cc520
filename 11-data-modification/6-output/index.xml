    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, weâ€™re going to be taking a look at how we might see the results of any data modifications that happen as part of our SQL queries. So, in order to see more fine grained details of what happens when we update, delete, or inserts will use the output command, or the output clause is going to return information about anything that was affected as a result of our queries.</description>
