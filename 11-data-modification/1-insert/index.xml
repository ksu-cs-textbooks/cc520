    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to start talking about data modification queries in SQL. So data modification, if remember, is one of two major parts of the SQL language. So we have data manipulation language, or DML, and Data Definition Language, or DDL. So far, we’ve been focusing on learning the SELECT clause and all of the other statements that go along with it. That is one of the six statements that we have in the data manipulation language. So DML is going to allow also insertion So inserting data, updating data that is already exists, and deleting data that is in our tables. And we can also combine a number of those statements together using a MERGE statement, which we’ll also be covering. But first off, let’s talk about insertion. So inserting data is a pretty flexible statement inside SQL and SQL server two to go along with that. But for now, we’re going to focus on just the standard insert statements. So insert values, insert, select, and insert Exec. And we’ll show an example of each of these. But these are also standard statements.</description>
