    <title>Identity &amp; Sequence Objects :: CC 520 Textbook</title>

    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, weâ€™re going to continue our discussion on data modification. And in particular, what happens when we use Insert on a table that has columns that are identity or sequence objects. So, in general, a lot of our tables are going to have an identity column or a sequence object, because a lot of what our keys are based off of our primary keys are usually going to be a surrogate key that is, generally speaking, auto numbered.</description>
