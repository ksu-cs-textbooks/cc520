    <title>Identity &amp; Sequence Objects :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/11-data-modification/2-identity-sequence/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to continue our discussion on data modification. And in particular, what happens when we use Insert on a table that has columns that are identity or sequence objects. So, in general, a lot of our tables are going to have an identity column or a sequence object, because a lot of what our keys are based off of our primary keys are usually going to be a surrogate key that is, generally speaking, auto numbered. And so that’s where the identity column or sequence objects are very beneficial to use for, in general, we do have three different possible ways to utilize the values coming out of the that identity function. And so we have the Add identity, and this is going to return whatever value was generated last, from the last query that we executed on that table. So if we inserted the first record in a table, and that identity, for that column was one at identity will actually pull the that one out. And we can utilize that as just like a variable inside of our queries. Likewise, we have scope identity, which returns the last value that was generated by that identity column by the last session in the current scope, and I’ll showcase an example of how this actually differs from the, the previous at identity.</description>
