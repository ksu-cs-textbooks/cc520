    <title>What is a Database? :: CC 520 Textbook</title>

    <description>YouTube Video Example Data Here we can see some basic information about universities in a table. Much of the data we use in relational databases resemble this format, except the information is typically at a much larger scale. A lot of situations find this data being stored in spreadsheets, comma separated value (csv) files, and alike; however, these formats have limited capability in manipulating and storing data. Spreadsheet applications can do some of this type of work, but there are limitsâ€¦particularly in terms of scalability, accessibility, and reliability.</description>
