    <title>Join Review :: CC 520 Textbook</title>

    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at our last and final join outer joins. Outer Joins in particular have three different variations for left and right. But before we get into a new joint, let’s take a look at the material that we’ve covered so far. So last time, we covered a lot of cross joins and inner joins, which are both table operators, that we can utilize to have queries that pull from more than one table. Initially, we covered only tables that we’re pulling from just a single table. And so our FROM clause wasn’t very complicated. But then we learned we can use things like cross join an inner join, to pull from, you know, two, three, or even more different, different tables and join those all into one single table as a result, SQL Server in particular, supports four different table operators join, apply, pivot and pivot. For this class, we are only focusing on join in particular, but and join is the only standard operator anyways, apply pivot and Unpivot. You may not see in other SQL languages like my SQL and Postgres.</description>
