    <title>Multivalue Correlated Subqueries Part 2 :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/05-subqueries/6-multivalue-correlated-subqueries-part-2/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. Let’s continue our discussion on correlated sub queries. So previously, we showed some different examples on how we can rewrite different sub queries with different operations like left join, we compared the differences between or the results of the in operator in the exists operator. But let’s take a look at a deeper example. Or a larger example of a correlated sub query, or at least another common use. It’s one of the common uses that I listed, we’re running totals and for a variety of calculations like that. So this is one variation of that use case. So most of the most of this query is something that we actually have done before, it appears more complicated than it really is. So let’s first start out by explaining this query using the from clause since that’s where we initially start out with our processing. So from sales orders, enter, join on sales order lines, where order date is between in 2015. And then we group group by order ID and dates, order by the dates, and percentage daily total. The columns that we pull out here are order date, order, order ID, the order total, which we have calculated before in a previous video. But the big addition here is this sub query here.</description>
