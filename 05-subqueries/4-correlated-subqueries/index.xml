    <title>Correlated Subqueries :: CC 520 Textbook</title>

    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. And in this video, we’re going to continue our discussion on sub queries. So previously, we learned that we could nest one query inside of another. And that led us to having outer queries and inner queries or sub queries, and the those results of the inner query then being passed back for processing and the outer query. And we also learned that with sub queries, we have two primary variations, self contained and correlated sub queries. With each of those having three potential types of returns single values, multiple values with one column or table valued, meaning that we have more than one column with zero more rows. Table valued sub queries are going to be reserved for another video. But what’s the difference between self contained and correlated sub queries? Well, remember that self contained sub queries are able to be executed in isolation, meaning that there’s no dependency between the outer query or the inner query with the outer query. Logically, self contained queries are executed only once, and the result is then passed back to the outer query for use. correlated sub queries, on the other hand, do have a dependency on the outer query. So the inner query here in case of a correlated sub query is going to have some reference to the outer query.</description>
