    <title>Multi-value Self-contained Subqueries :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/05-subqueries/3-multivalue-self-contained-subqueries/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, weâ€™re going to be taking another look at self contained sub queries. But more specifically, self contained sub queries that return more than one row as a result with one column. So self contained sub queries, remember is a query that can execute in isolation, apart from our outer query. But a multivalued self contained sub query is going to be a sub query that returns one single column, but potentially more than one row.</description>
