    <title>Multi-value Self-contained Subqueries :: CC 520 Textbook</title>

    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be taking another look at self contained sub queries. But more specifically, self contained sub queries that return more than one row as a result with one column. So self contained sub queries, remember is a query that can execute in isolation, apart from our outer query. But a multivalued self contained sub query is going to be a sub query that returns one single column, but potentially more than one row. So these types of queries can be utilized with predicates like N, or also things like exists as well, which we’ll take a look at. But syntax looks something like this. So the scalar expression, so it could be a column, or a single value in and then the result of the sub query. Most of the time, this type of sub query, though, can be rewritten using joins, and I’ll show a few examples of this. Okay, so let’s take a look at a self contained multivalued sub query. So in this example, I have a another variable up here, that is just specifying a specific date. And then in my sub query down here, I have a select for customer ID customer name from customers, where the customer ID equals and then this result here. So let’s go ahead and execute our sub query. Cheat for just a second, because I need my variable declared appear.</description>
