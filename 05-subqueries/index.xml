      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video we&amp;rsquo;re going to be focusing on sub queries. Now up to this point, we&amp;rsquo;ve covered how to do single table queries. Multi table queries with join. So Inner Joins cross joins outer joins. But in this video, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be focusing on how we can nest queries inside of each other. But before that, let&amp;rsquo;s review a few things. Remember our processing order of SQL and the order that we write SQL is different.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on self contained sub queries. And specifically examples of self contained sub queries that return only scalar, or single values. So self contained sub queries, if you remember, have no dependency on the outer query. So we can execute these queries in isolation, without any without any information from other queries. Logically, self contained sub queries are only executed once.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be taking another look at self contained sub queries. But more specifically, self contained sub queries that return more than one row as a result with one column. So self contained sub queries, remember is a query that can execute in isolation, apart from our outer query. But a multivalued self contained sub query is going to be a sub query that returns one single column, but potentially more than one row.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. And in this video, we&amp;rsquo;re going to continue our discussion on sub queries. So previously, we learned that we could nest one query inside of another. And that led us to having outer queries and inner queries or sub queries, and the those results of the inner query then being passed back for processing and the outer query. And we also learned that with sub queries, we have two primary variations, self contained and correlated sub queries.</description>

      <title>Multi-value Correlated Subqueries Part 1</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cc520-sql-server-textbook/05-subqueries/5-multivalue-correlated-subqueries/index.html</link>

      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back, everyone. So let&amp;rsquo;s continue our discussion on correlated sub queries. So previously, I showed some examples of a correlated sub queries primarily, though with scalar value return, so correlated subqueries, that only had one value as a result. However, the distinction between that and a self contained valued a self contained single valued sub query is that the correlated version has to be executed for every single row four, the outer query, versus the self contained query is only executed once.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. Let&amp;rsquo;s continue our discussion on correlated sub queries. So previously, we showed some different examples on how we can rewrite different sub queries with different operations like left join, we compared the differences between or the results of the in operator in the exists operator. But let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at a deeper example. Or a larger example of a correlated sub query, or at least another common use.</description>
