    <title>Common Table Expressions :: CC 520 Textbook</title>

    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at common table expressions, otherwise known as CTS. We can see the syntax of a common table expression here on this particular site here, but it’ll show some examples that will make this a little bit easier to read. So, as I mentioned, common table expressions are also known as C, T E’s. They’re very similar to derive tables write, similar in nature that the scope is limited to the outer query. But the benefit of a CTE is all of these things here. So probably the biggest benefits between a CTE and a derived derived table is that we can reference a CTE more than once. So previously, when we talked about derived tables, we, we were shown a derived table cannot be referenced more than once. So we can’t do a self join, for example, on a derived table, but with a CTE, that’s going to be possible. Along with derive tables, we can also do in line and external ABC and CTS, we can also utilize more than one CTE in the same query. And CTE is can also be recursive. We’re going to save recursive CTE, though, for a nother video, that’s a more complicated topic. But just like you can call and reference a function within a function, we can have a CTE that references itself. So recursion, but nonetheless, let’s take a look at a few examples of a CTE.</description>
