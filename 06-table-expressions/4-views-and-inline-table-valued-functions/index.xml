    <title>Views and Inline Table-valued Functions :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/06-table-expressions/4-views-and-inline-table-valued-functions/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, weâ€™re going to be taking a look at views and table valued functions. And so up here I have both of the syntax for each. So have the syntax for review and the syntax for inline table valued functions. And I will show the Show More examples of these and will hopefully make a little bit more sense then views and inline table valued functions are provide an extra benefits when compared to derive tables and CTS.</description>
