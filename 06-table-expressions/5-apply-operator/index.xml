    <title>The Apply Operator :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/06-table-expressions/5-apply-operator/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. And this video, we’re going to be taking a look at the Apply operator. So this is going to be our last table expression that we’re going to be looking at for this course. But again, the general syntax of the Apply operator is included up here. But I will of course, show some examples of how that looks. But what is the Apply operator. So apply itself is non standard syntax apply is unique to SQL Server, if you are looking in other SQL based languages, you’ll be looking for what is called a lateral join. But SQL Server calls this the apply operation. But in general, how this operates is apply as a table value a table operator, and so your the left and right hand side need to be table expressions. Or rephrase that. On the left hand side, we must have an actual table and the right hand side of the Apply can actually be a table expression. So it could be a CTE, it could be a T provided sub query or or anything alike, but some table expression on the right hand side. Now, the main benefits that we get out of using the apply or otherwise known as the lateral join, it allows us to do a join on a correlated sub query, right.</description>
