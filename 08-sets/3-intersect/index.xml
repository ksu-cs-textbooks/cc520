    <title>Intersect :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/08-sets/3-intersect/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. And in this video, we’re going to be taking a look at our next set operator intersect. So the the query syntax is very similar to what we’ve seen so far, we have an input query on the left and input query on the right the set operator in between, and an optional order by at the end. But do note that intersect does not have an intersect all option.</description>
