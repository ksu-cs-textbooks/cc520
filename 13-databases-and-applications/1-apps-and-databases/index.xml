    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be talking about how we might use a database and programming application to use it. And first off as well, I do apologize for my voice. I’m kind of losing it today. But please bear with me, as we get through this things that we’ve covered. So far, we’ve covered quite a few things, running from single table and multi table queries, updates, deletes, and a lot of things in between.</description>
