###  Course Structure
This course is being taught 100% online, and each module is self-paced. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work at their own pace through a set of modules, with approximately one module being due each week. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a hands-on lab assignment, which will be graded interactively by the instructor. Assignments may also include written portions or presentations, which will be submitted online.

### Grading
There will be two midterm exams and one final exam for the course. Students will be evaluated based on exams, homework assignments, and a term project. Students are highly encouraged to attend every lecture (either in-person or online) and to participate in discussion. 

Assignments are to be completed without any collaboration with classmates or other outside help unless otherwise stated. Any unauthorized aid may result in a 0 for the assignment or an XF for the course and a report submitted to the Academic Honor Council. All assignments will be submitted through Canvas. The specific grading scheme is shown below:

- Quizzes: 50%
- Homework assignments: 25%
- Final Project: 25%
#### Late Work

{{% notice warning%}}

Poor planning/procrastination on your part does not constitute as an emergency on ours.

{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. **Late work will receive penalty of 1% of the possible points for each partial hour it is late**. Some assignments will NOT be accepted late! Others will be limited to a maximum of three days late (not always 3 days).

## Subject to Change

The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the K-State Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.

### Diversity and Inclusion
{{% notice note %}}
This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from [this statement](https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/1625) created by two educators at Brown University. We feel that a statement such as this is very powerful and important in today's world, and we'll do our best to live up to it.
{{% /notice %}}

In an ideal world, science and technology would be objective. However, much of science and technology is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will reference many materials from a diverse set of sources, but limits still exist on this diversity. I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a technical nature.

Please contact me or submit anonymous feedback through the Computer Science department office if you have any concerns or suggestions regarding this course and related materials.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this:

* If you have a name and/or use pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official K-State records, please let me know!
* If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Please remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback as described above (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary, to address your concerns).
* If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic advisor or the staff in the College of Engineering Student Services office are excellent resources.

I, like many people, am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class, by anyone, that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.

### Netiquette

{{% notice note %}}
This is our personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from [this statement](https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/) from K-State Global Campus, and the [Recurse Center Manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual). We have adapted their ideas to fit this course.
{{% /notice %}}

Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the _context_ and _body language_ of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker _means_, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.

Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Piazza:

* **Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.** Subject lines such as "Question" or "Problem" are not helpful. Subjects such as "Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java" or "Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python" give plenty of information about your topic.
* **Use only one topic per message.** If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.
* **Be thorough, concise, and to the point.** Ideally, each message should be a page or less.
* **Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.** It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you've tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.
* **Consider carefully what you write before you post it.** Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.
* **If you are lost, don't know an answer, or don't understand something, speak up!** Piazza allows you to send a message privately to the instructors, or post anonymously so other students don't know your identity. Don't be afraid to ask questions anytime, as you can choose to do so without any fear of being identified by your fellow students.
* **Class discussions are confidential.** Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.
* **Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.** When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.
* **Do not use all caps.** It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.
* **No feigning surprise.** If someone asks a question, saying things like "I can't believe you don't know that!" are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.
* **No "well-actually's."** If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a "well, actually..." correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don't post a correction just for the sake of being correct.
* **Do not correct someone's grammar or spelling.** Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad. If there is a genuine mistake that may affect the meaning of the post, please contact the person privately or let the instructors know privately so it can be resolved. 
* **Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.** Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.
* **Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.** They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.

As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the [K-State Principles of Community](https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/).

## Academic Honesty
Kansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on  personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in  academic matters one's work is performed honestly and without  unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by  registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor & Integrity  System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all  full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate  courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.

A component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the [Honor Pledge](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/basics/pledge.html) which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, *whether or not* it is stated: **"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."**

The default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished  individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an  assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please  ask

A [grade of XF](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/faculty-tips/policy-agreement.html) can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure  in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

For more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home web page at: [http://www.k-state.edu/honor/](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/)

{{% notice warning %}}

The standard policy for this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in an automatic 0 for the assignment and the violation will be reported to the Honor System. A second violation will result in an XF in the course. The sanctions will apply to **ALL** parties involved in the violation.

**Note that depending on the severity of the first violation, the sanction may be worse than just a 0 for the assignment**

## Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to  technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation  processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their  instructor. Services are available to students with a wide range of  disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities,  medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder,  depression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in campus/online  courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student  Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu?subject=Student Accommodation), 785-532-6441; for K-State Polytechnic campus, contact Julie Rowe, Diversity, Inclusion and Access Coordinator, at [jarowe@ksu.edu](mailto:jarowe@ksu.edu) or call 785-826-2971.

## Expectations for Classroom Conduct

All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the [Student Judicial Conduct Code](http://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/) as outlined in the Student Governing Association [By Laws](http://www.k-state.edu/sga/old_files/sgadocs/ByLaws.pdf), Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.

## Wearing of Face Coverings
To protect the health and safety of the  K-State community, students, faculty, staff and visitors must wear face  coverings over their mouths and noses in all indoor and outdoor spaces  while you are on university property unless you are alone in a private  office or workspace or alone outdoors. In addition, all new students are required to complete [face covering training](https://kstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eJ6LHbFIJ8GFD7f) that also covers COVID-19 transmission, risk mitigation and the Every  Wildcat a Wellcat pledge. Students needing accommodations may contact  the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu).

In classrooms, faculty have the right to  deny a student entry into the room if the student is not wearing a face  covering. Students not wearing a face covering will be reminded to do so and offered a clean face covering, if one is available. If the student  does not comply, the faculty member will ask the student to leave the  space, and if available, join the class remotely. As a last resort,  campus police will be called. The faculty member will complete the [Code of Conduct form](https://www.k-state.edu/report/conduct-violation/) and the Office of Student Life will look further into the issue and take  the non-compliance with the request to leave into consideration of  further accountability measures. 

At no point should the  professor or other students put themselves into an unsafe situation  while attempting to enforce the face-covering policy.

## Statement on Mental Health
Your mental health and good relationships are vital to your overall  well-being. Symptoms of mental health issues may include excessive  sadness or worry, thoughts of death or self-harm, inability to  concentrate, lack of motivation, or substance abuse. Although problems  can occur anytime for anyone, you should pay extra attention to your  mental health if you are feeling academic or financial stress,  discrimination, or have experienced a traumatic event, such as loss of a friend or family member, sexual assault or other physical or emotional  abuse. 

If you are struggling with these issues, do not wait to seek assistance.

## Student Resources

K-State has many resources to help contribute to student success. These  resources include accommodations for academics, paying for college,  student life, health and safety, and others found at [www.k-state.edu/onestop](https://www.k-state.edu/onestop)

## Academic Freedom Statement

Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public. Although new ideas or research results may be controversial, or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university's mission. 

Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.

## Campus Safety
Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for faculty members and students. In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how to follow any emergency directives. To view additional campus emergency information go to the University's main page (http://www.ksu.edu) and click on the Emergency Information button.

## Weapons Policy Statement

Kansas State University prohibits the possession and use of firearms, explosives, and other weapons on any University campus, with certain limited exceptions, which include use of weapons as part of approved University Programs, use of weapons by law enforcement personnel, and the lawful concealed carrying of handguns, as provided in the weapons policy, which may be found at: http://www.k-state.edu/police/weapons/index.html

## Concealed Carry Statement

Under the Weapons Policy, individuals who carry a concealed handgun must have the handgun on or about their person at all times. Backpacks are appropriate for carrying a handgun as long as the backpack remains within the exclusive and uninterrupted control of the individual. A backpack or other bag used to carry a handgun must be within the immediate reach of the individual. Before bringing a concealed carry handgun into a University building, individuals who choose to carry a concealed handgun in a backpack, bag, etc., should consider whether or not they may be required to be separated from their handgun, such as being asked to go to the front of a classroom or to store bags in a particular area in a lab or exam room. In this course, the instructor may require students to place backpacks or other bags out of reach for safety or other reasons. The instructor will notify students in advance of this requirement so a student who carries a concealed handgun in a backpack or a bag may take steps to conceal the handgun on his or her person before arriving, or otherwise plan accordingly.

 *In this class, students will be asked on a regular basis to participate in activities, such as engaging in group work, using the board, etc. These activities may require students to either be separated from their bags or be prepared to keep their bags with them at all times during such activities. Students are encouraged to take the online weapons policy education module (*[*http://www.k-state.edu/police/weapons/index.html*](http://www.k-state.edu/police/weapons/index.html) *) to ensure they understand the requirements related to concealed carry.*
