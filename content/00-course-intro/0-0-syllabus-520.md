* CC 410 - Advanced Programming (Prerequisite or Concurrent Enrollment)
* Optional: MATH 312 - Finite Applications of Mathematics or MATH 510 - Discrete Mathematics

### Recommended Texts
These books are **not** required.  I will be providing notes, videos, and walk through examples durring the course.  If you are looking for more traditional text-book material, I have found these books to be helpful.

- T-SQL Fundamentals (Third Edition) by Itzik Ben-Gan
- Database Systems: The Complete Book (Second Edition) by Hector Garcia-Molina, Jeffrey D. Ullman, Jennifer Widom
- SQL Success - Database Programming Proficiency by Stephane Faroult

### Required Software

We will be utilizing MS SQL Server for this course.  For information about accessing SQL Server for the course, see [SQL Server Access](/cc520/00-course-intro/0-1-mssqlserver). 

### Course Overview

Introduction to concepts and techniques in database management. Overview of relational databases, NoSQL databases, and related topics. Database programming and use of databases in applications. Theory and architecture of database management systems (DBMS).

### Course Description

The purpose of this course is to introduce concepts, approaches, and techniques in database management. This includes exploring the representation of information as data, data storage techniques, foundations of data models, data retrieval, database design, transaction management, integrity and security.

### Student Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, a successful student will be able to:
* Write and read SQL, including queries, relations, database modifications, constraints, triggers, transactions, and views.
* Recognize the difference between NoSQL and its philosophy compared to SQL.
* Design and create databases utilizing entity relationship models, functional dependencies, and normalization.
* Design queries and databases that are optimized in storage, retrieval, and processing of data.
* Create an application that utilizes a database.

### Major Course Topics

* SQL Language
* NoSQL & its relation to SQL
* DBMS design
* Programming with databases
* Database system architecture
* Database efficiency
* Practical applications of databases

###  Course Structure
This course is being taught 100% online. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work through each set of modules, with weekly or bi-weekly due dates. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a hands-on assignment, which will be graded interactively by the instructor. Assignments may also include written portions or presentations, which will be submitted online.

### Grading
There will be three exams for the course. Students will be evaluated based on exams, homework assignments, and a term project. Assignments are to be completed without any collaboration with classmates or other outside help unless otherwise stated. Any unauthorized aid may result in a 0 for the assignment or an XF for the course and a report submitted to the Academic Honor Council. All assignments will be submitted through Canvas. The specific grading scheme is shown below:

- Exams/Quizzes: 45%
- Homework assignments: 25%
- Final Project: 30%

#### Assignments

{{% notice warning %}}
All work is expected to be done individually unless otherwise stated. A violation of the Honor Code Policy (see below) will result in an automatic 0 for the assignment and the violation will be reported to the Honor System. A second violation will result in an XF in the course. The sanctions will apply to **ALL** parties involved in the violation.

**Note that depending on the severity of the first violation, the sanction may be worse than just a 0 for the assignment**

{{% /notice %}}
There will be some programming and written assignments (majority will be SQL-based, but may involve some coding like the final project). It is acceptable to communicate with other students about the **concepts** in the assignment if you do not understand it, but you should not discuss the details of how the assignment should be completed (never share your code/work with another student!). Your submission should be your own work, or the work of your small group if allowed by the instructor. ***When in doubt, ask!\***

In order to avoid turning in code or SQL that does not work (or maybe even the wrong file) please double check your solution after you submitted it to Canvas. **Redownload** what you submitted from Canvas and run it again to assure that the program you submitted is working as intended.

#### Late Work

{{% notice warning%}}

Poor planning/procrastination on your part does not constitute as an emergency on ours.

{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. **Late work will receive penalty of 10% of the possible points for each day its late**. Some assignments will NOT be accepted late! Others will be limited to a maximum of three days late (not always 3 days). Note that this penalty is applied on a **per hour basis** (*i.e. if your assignment is 12 hours late, it will receive a ~5% deduction*)

## Subject to Change

The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the K-State Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.
