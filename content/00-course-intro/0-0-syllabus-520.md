### How to Get Help in this Course

CC 520 Database Essentials is not like your standard programming course. We will be doing some programming, but our focus will be primarily with data; how to store it, retrieve it, manipulate it, and use it with an application. Some of the topics we will cover are easier than others, but some can be fairly tricky. That, coupled with this being an online course, you are encouraged to seek help whenever you feel you are being overwhelmed or don't understand a topic. **You are not alone!** We will **_always_** be willing to help students with **_any_** questions you may have about the class or other issues related to Computing Science. So please, don't be afraid to ask questions. Get help early and often!

Here are the 5 **recommended ways to get help** in this course:

- Review the course materials posted on K-State Canvas and the course website
- Check the [Edstem Discussion board](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/191198/external_tools/25887?display=borderless) to see if a similar question has been asked, otherwise, post a new question.
- Visit your professor's office hours, or the office hours for your TA if available
- Send a message to the CIS 520 Help email ([cc520-help@KSUemailProd.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:cc520-help@KSUemailProd.onmicrosoft.com?subject=CC20520%20Help))).
- Ask your teammates for help or advice on assignments or projects (be mindful of the honor code!)
- Schedule a one-on-one meeting with your professor/TA

This semester, we will be using edstem.org, specifically, their Ed Discussion platform. Ed Discussion is a reddit/forum style web app that allows students to post and ask questions. This will be our preferred way of communication when it comes to questions/etc. in the course. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Before creating a new thread, please make sure there isn't a similar one already made.
- If you are asking a question in Ed Discussion, please correctly mark it as such along with the correct tags.
- Please make your thread public when possible in case others have the same questions.
- Threads can be made _anonymous_ when needed. Course staff may anonymize private threads and make them public if they find it to be beneficial for the class.
- When posting code, please do not post solutions or part of solutions to homework. If you need to share your code with us, please make your thread private.
- If you would like a new category or tag made, please let us know!

### Course Structure

This course is being taught 100% online. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work through each set of modules, with weekly or bi-weekly due dates. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a hands-on assignment, which will be graded interactively by the instructor. Assignments may also include written portions or presentations, which will be submitted online.

### Grading

There will be three exams for the course. Students will be evaluated based on exams, homework assignments, and a term project. Assignments are to be completed without any collaboration with classmates or other outside help unless otherwise stated. Any unauthorized aid may result in a 0 for the assignment or an XF for the course and a report submitted to the Academic Honor Council. All assignments will be submitted through Canvas. The specific grading scheme is shown below:

- Exams/Quizzes: 25%
- Homework assignments: 30%
- Final Project: 45%

### Assignments

{{% notice warning %}}
All work is expected to be done individually unless otherwise stated. Work submitted to canvas must be 100% your own work (without unauthorized assistance, including AI). A violation of the Honor Code Policy (see below) will result in an automatic 0 for the assignment and the violation will be reported to the Honor System. A second violation will result in an XF in the course. The sanctions will apply to **ALL** parties involved in the violation.

**Note that depending on the severity of the first violation, the sanction may be worse than just a 0 for the assignment**

{{% /notice %}}
There will be some programming and written assignments (majority will be SQL-based, but may involve some coding like the final project). It is acceptable to communicate with other students about the **concepts** in the assignment if you do not understand it, but you should not discuss the details of how the assignment should be completed (never share your code/work with another student!). Your submission should be your own work, or the work of your small group if allowed by the instructor. **\*When in doubt, ask!\***

In order to avoid turning in code or SQL that does not work (or maybe even the wrong file) please double check your solution after you submitted it to Canvas. **Redownload** what you submitted from Canvas and run it again to assure that the program you submitted is working as intended.

#### Late Work

{{% notice warning%}}

Poor planning/procrastination on your part does not constitute as an emergency on ours.

{{% /notice %}}

Every student should strive to turn in work on time. **Late work will receive penalty of 10% of the possible points for each day its late**. Some assignments will NOT be accepted late! Others will be limited to a maximum of three days late (not always 3 days). Note that this penalty is applied on a **per hour basis** (_i.e. if your assignment is 12 hours late, it will receive a ~5% deduction_)

### Artificial Intelligence Usage Policy

This course uses a stoplight approach regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and others. Most assignments or group of assignments will be clearly labelled with one of three labels, indicating what level of GenAI usage is allowed. If an assignment does not have a label, it should be assumed that GenAI usage is **prohibited**. The three labels are described below:

{{% badge style="red" %}}RED: GenAI Prohibited {{% /badge %}} You may not use any GenAI tools to complete this assignment. This assignment's main goal is to develop your own skills related to a particular task or topic, or to assess your own understanding of the concepts and skills required for this course. GenAI tools are therefore prohibited for these assignments, as they do not reflect or enhance your own learning journey. <cite>stoplight CSS generated by ChatGPT-4.1</cite>

<div style="clear: both"></div>

**Policy Violations:** Any usage of GenAI for this assignment will be treated as a violation of the K-State Honor Pledge and may result in a grade of 0 for the assignment and other sanctions approved through the K-State Honor Council.

{{% badge style="orange" %}}YELLOW: Limited GenAI Usage Allowed {{% /badge %}} You may use GenAI tools in a limited way to complete this assignment. The assignment description may provide additional information about what tools are allowed and how they can be used. The goal of this assignment is to allow you to work with GenAI to complete a task or achieve a goal, but the completed work should still be a majority your own effort. <cite>stoplight CSS generated by ChatGPT-4.1</cite>


<div style="clear: both"></div>

**Citations Required:** Any usage of GenAI must be noted and cited directly in the work, either in source code comments or text citations in written work. Citations should include the tool used, the prompt(s) given, context provided to the tool (e.g. existing code), and a discussion of how the results were used to complete the assignment.

**No Direct AI Results:** For this assignment, you **may not** include the GenAI results directly in your submission - it must be used to inform and adapted to fit your own work. For example, you may not prompt GenAI tools to just _write_ your code and submit that directly; instead, you should ask for help performing specific tasks and then use the results within your own work.

**Understand Your Work:** To ensure compliance with this policy, the instructor reserves the right to request additional discussion or explanation of any work submitted by a student. The student should understand and be able to clearly explain **all** submitted work and code, even materials directly or indirectly produced by GenAI. A student who is unable to explain a submission to the satisfaction of the instructor may be considered to be in violation of this policy.

**Policy Violations:** Any usage of GenAI that involves direct submission of the GenAI outputs without additional work done by the student, or use of GenAI without proper citation, may be treated as a violation of the K-State Honor Pledge and may result in a grade of 0 for the assignment and other sanctions approved through the K-State Honor Council.

**Direct AI Results Allowed:** For this assignment, you **may** include the GenAI results directly in your submission. It is still your responsibility to ensure the submission meets the assignment's goals and is correct and factual - remember that GenAI is not infallible and may produce incorrect results. You are still solely responsible for ensuring the submission meets the stated assignment goals, and assignments in this category may receive additional scrutiny for correctness and accuracy.

**Understand Your Work:** To ensure compliance with this policy, the instructor reserves the right to request additional discussion or explanation of any work submitted by a student. The student should understand and be able to clearly explain **all** submitted work and code, even materials directly or indirectly produced by GenAI.
