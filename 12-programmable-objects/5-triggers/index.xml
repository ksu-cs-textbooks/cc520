    <title>Triggers :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/12-programmable-objects/5-triggers/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to start taking a look at another type of stored procedure called triggers. As I mentioned, triggers are a special kind of stored procedure, which is actually attached to an event that happens or occurs in our database. So we typically won’t be actually executing triggers manually, they are automatically executed. Whenever the event occurs. Think like a click event handler when you’re programming a user interface, and Java or Python or a website.</description>
