    <title>Triggers :: CC 520 Textbook</title>

    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to start taking a look at another type of stored procedure called triggers. As I mentioned, triggers are a special kind of stored procedure, which is actually attached to an event that happens or occurs in our database. So we typically won’t be actually executing triggers manually, they are automatically executed. Whenever the event occurs. Think like a click event handler when you’re programming a user interface, and Java or Python or a website. So, events that can have triggers attached as defined by the NC SQL standard are before insert, update, or delete, and after insert, update or delete. So, before an insert, update, or delete happens, execute this query first or the stored procedure first, or, or conversely, after an insert, update or delete happens, execute this stored procedure. SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server only supports after from the standard. And then instead of before they do the instead of event. Okay, and I’ll talk about some of the differences here with instead of but before can be duplicated in T SQL by using after and are temporary tables.</description>
