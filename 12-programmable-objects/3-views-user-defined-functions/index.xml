    <title>Views &amp; User Defined Functions :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/12-programmable-objects/3-views-user-defined-functions/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, weâ€™re going to be taking another look at views and user defined functions. So remember, a view is a logical construct only. And it is considered also a table expressions. So remember, views are just queries that we created and stored as part of our database. But the data that the view actually pulls from is not actually stored. Again, as part of the view, the view is nothing more than just a query that retrieves data from other tables.</description>
