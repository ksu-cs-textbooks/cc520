    <title>Stored Procedures :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/12-programmable-objects/4-stored-procedures/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be taking a look at stored procedures. So so far we have talked about some routines like user defined functions. Routines are nothing more than database objects that are stored as part of your database. But we have some differences here that that start to come out when we start talking about stored procedures. So we’ve seen views and user defined functions with both of them do provide some intermittent level of abstraction, it does insulate your database a little bit from your users, so your users don’t interact directly with the table. So it does provide some security as well. But stored procedures have a little bit more flexibility in that regard, we can also keep all of our error handling in one place. And so we can start to do things like exception caching, and handling like that, which we’ll show in another video. But the primary difference between stored procedures and things like user defined functions and views is that it will start to provide some performance benefits as well. So things like caching, and other things start to happen here, and apart from what you see, in user defined functions and views. But nonetheless, let’s take a look at some examples of this working.</description>
