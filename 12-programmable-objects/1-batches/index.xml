    <title>Batches :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/12-programmable-objects/1-batches/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be starting our discussion on programmable objects. And we’ll be covering a lot of different topics in this video series. But first, we’re going to talk about batches. So batches aren’t necessarily a programmable object. But we really do need to understand how sequel runs, queries in batches. So we can understand scope, and how programmable objects are actually functioning. So batches are chunks of SQL queries, or a series of SQL queries that are are sent to the database server as one unit. So we could have five SQL queries in a row. And those could be sent as a batch to our Microsoft SQL Server service. So far, what we’ve used with batches is just highlighting SQL queries and running it or each of the, like Jupyter Notebook cells, that is, when you press run on a cell that is considered to be a batch. Or if you have a sequel file without any ghost statements, that entire file would be sent to the database server as a full batch. But the addition of the Go syntax is going to allow you to separate SQL queries inside one file into batches. And this is really important when we start talking about scope of things like variables, for example, also certain programmable objects and CTS and things like that. But it does allow us to separate things out. And this can help logically organize our SQL queries into smaller chunks.</description>
