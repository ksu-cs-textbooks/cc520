    <title>Database Design Example :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/09-obtaining-good-design/2-database-design-example/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. And in this video, we’re going to be taking a look at an example database design. So we’ve shown some basic database, UML diagrams, but we really haven’t taken the time to draw our own yet. So in this example, we’re going to take a look at designing a really basic database for offering college courses on a campus like K State, a course is going to be defined by its number delivered by a department in a college and offered certain semesters at the same time on various days of the week.</description>
