    <title>Anomolies and Armstrong Rules :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/09-obtaining-good-design/6-anomolies-armstrong-rules/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. And in this video, we’re going to be taking a look at various ways of pulling out more functional dependencies. Inside of our relations. Particularly, we’re going to be focusing on how we can avoid anomalies and pulling more functional dependencies out using the Armstrong rules. So first off, what is an anomaly? Well, anomaly. An anomaly can be defined as essentially a bad functional dependency, and particularly where where a bad functional dependency holds based off of the current data that we have.</description>
