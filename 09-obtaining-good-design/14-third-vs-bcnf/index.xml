    <title>Third Normal Form vs BCNF :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/09-obtaining-good-design/14-third-vs-bcnf/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be talking more about the third normal form. And so just read your reiterates our statement that we’ve seen, so far every non key attribute must provide a fact about the key the whole key and nothing but the key. This was famously famously done by William Kinte, who was the database researcher, but this really, really fills out our need for third normal form right we have any any non prime attributes must not be a functional dependency right if we have a non prime attribute that is a functional dependency or implies another column that is not the key, then we have an issue we need to split that out into its own table.</description>
