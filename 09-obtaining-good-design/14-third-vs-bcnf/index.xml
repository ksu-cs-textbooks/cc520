    <title>Third Normal Form vs BCNF :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/09-obtaining-good-design/14-third-vs-bcnf/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. In this video, we’re going to be talking more about the third normal form. And so just read your reiterates our statement that we’ve seen, so far every non key attribute must provide a fact about the key the whole key and nothing but the key. This was famously famously done by William Kinte, who was the database researcher, but this really, really fills out our need for third normal form right we have any any non prime attributes must not be a functional dependency right if we have a non prime attribute that is a functional dependency or implies another column that is not the key, then we have an issue we need to split that out into its own table. So, as a refresher right third normal form, if a relation R is in third normal form, if for every non trivial functional dependency in our where a one through a n implies B, then A one through a n must be a super key if it is not or it is not part of the key then it is not in third normal form. So, if the functional dependency the left hand side of a functional dependency is not a super key, or it is not part of a key, then it is not in third normal form. So let’s talk about some differences here with third normal form versus Boyce Codd Normal form because we’ve covered Boyce Codd Normal Form quite a bit.</description>
