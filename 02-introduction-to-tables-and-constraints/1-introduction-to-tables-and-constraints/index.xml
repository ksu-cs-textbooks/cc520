    <title>Introduction to Tables and Constraints :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/02-introduction-to-tables-and-constraints/1-introduction-to-tables-and-constraints/</link>
    <description>Video Transcription Welcome everyone. In this video, we’re going to take our first look into some sequels, specifically t SQL, which is Microsoft’s implementation of the SQL standard.So to start off, we’ll talk a little bit about basic table structure. We’ve talked up already in a previous lecture about general table structure, but not necessarily how we actually create that in our database. We’ll also do a basic introduction to constraints today, which includes the not null constraint, primary keys, unique keys, foreign keys, check constraints and default constraints. These are by no means all of the constraints that are possible to use in SQL, as well as SQL Server, which is the database system that we’ll be using. But this should get you a good introduction into them. And we’ll be covering and using these throughout the course.</description>
