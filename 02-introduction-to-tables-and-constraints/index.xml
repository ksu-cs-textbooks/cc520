      <description>Video Transcription Welcome everyone. In this video, we’re going to take our first look into some sequels, specifically t SQL, which is Microsoft’s implementation of the SQL standard.So to start off, we’ll talk a little bit about basic table structure. We’ve talked up already in a previous lecture about general table structure, but not necessarily how we actually create that in our database. We’ll also do a basic introduction to constraints today, which includes the not null constraint, primary keys, unique keys, foreign keys, check constraints and default constraints. These are by no means all of the constraints that are possible to use in SQL, as well as SQL Server, which is the database system that we’ll be using. But this should get you a good introduction into them. And we’ll be covering and using these throughout the course.</description>

      <description>Video Transcription Welcome back, everyone. This is part two of our introduction into tables and constraints. But now let’s start talking about key constraints. Key constraints are really important as part of our database design, because it enforces relationships and uniqueness of data throughout our individual tables. And across the relationships between those tables. Our first one here is a primary key constraint. Primary Key constraints make particular values for a column mandatory are required because a primary key uniquely identifies a row as part of an part of a table. That value being that uniquely identifies a particular record inside of a table must be unique. So we can’t have two identifiers are two values and as a primary key that are the same otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to uniquely identify a record or row in a table. And in our previous discussion, that is one of the major requirements in a relational database for table is that we must be able to uniquely identify a single tuple or row inside of a table to that primary key is really important to be unique. Also, notice here that in my ER diagram, I’ve changed a little bit of things here, the website column is gone, all of my columns here are also not italicized anymore, so everything is going to be required. And then we have our first key constraint added to our ER diagram here, PK for primary key, now more than one column can be a primary key.</description>
