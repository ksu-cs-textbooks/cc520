    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back, everyone. This is part two of our introduction into tables and constraints. But now letâ€™s start talking about key constraints. Key constraints are really important as part of our database design, because it enforces relationships and uniqueness of data throughout our individual tables. And across the relationships between those tables. Our first one here is a primary key constraint. Primary Key constraints make particular values for a column mandatory are required because a primary key uniquely identifies a row as part of an part of a table.</description>
