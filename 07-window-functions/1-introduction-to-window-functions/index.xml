    <title>Introduction to Window Functions :: CC 520 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc520/07-window-functions/1-introduction-to-window-functions/</link>
    <description>YouTube Video Video Transcription Welcome back everyone. And in this video series, we’re going to be taking a look at window functions. So with window functions, we’re actually going to be applying a function or an expression over a subset of rows from your query. And so the subset is actually referred to as the window. So hence the term window functions because we’re feeding the that small window of rows that saw a small subset of rows, and applying a function on top of that to calculate some value.</description>
